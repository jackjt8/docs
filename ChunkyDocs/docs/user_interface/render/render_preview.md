# Render Controls - Render Preview

![Render controls Render Preview](../../img/user_interface/render_controls/preview.png)

Once chunks have been selected and loaded they can be viewed in 3D within the Render Preview tab; Chunky should automatically switch to this view once chunks or a scene have been loaded. Depending on a few conditions either a fast flat path-traced preview image of the view into the world will be displayed OR, if either the render is started or there exists a dump file for the scene, a higher quality, and possibility noisy, multi-sample path-traced image will be shown; and updated in real-time as new samples are completed.

Below is an example of the path tracer in action.
