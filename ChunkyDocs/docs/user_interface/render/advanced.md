# Render Controls - Advanced

![Render controls Advanced](../../img/user_interface/render_controls/advanced.png)

## CPU usage controls

- `Render threads` - Changes the number of threads Chunky should use while rendering. (Needs restart)

- `CPU utilization` - Adds in sleep cycles to the rendering process to attempt to reduce the CPU usage. Would recommend using `Render threads` for more predictable scaling.

---

## Some quality/performance related options

- `Ray depth` - Controls the number of times a ray is allowed to bounce without striking a light source before killed. For outdoor scenes a value between 3-5 should typically be enough with indoor scenes benifitting more from higher values around 10. Higher values offer more realistic light bounce however at a cost to render time. Balance this carefully.

--

- `Merge render dump` - Useful for multi-PC rendering. Merges a renders .dump file into the currently loaded scene combining the total SPP.

---

- `Shutdown computer when render completes` - Togglable

- `Fast Fog` - Impacts the quality of fog rendering. Typically only noticable if viewing fog through alpha textures which is rare.

- `Sky cache resolution` - Resolution of the rendered simulated sky. Lower values may boost rendering performance at the cost of sky model accuracy. Default 128.

## Snapshot output format

- `Output mode` - `PNG` (default), `TIFF, 32-bit floating point`, `PFM, Portable FloatMap (32-bit)`

---

## Advanced Octree, BVH, and ESS options

- `Octree implementation` - `PACKED` (default), `BIGPACKED`, `NODE` (legacy)

- `BVH build method` - `SAH_MA` (default), `SAH`, `MIDPOINT`

- `Emitter grid size`- Controls size of emitter grid used for ESS.

- `Prevent normal emitter when using emitter sampling` - Attempts to disable typical random emitter hits which would reduce noise.

---

## Manual renderer selection

- `Renderer` - `PathTracingRenderer` - No other renderers are bundled. See plugins.

- `Preview Renderer` - `PreviewRenderer` - No other renderers are bundled. See plugins.
