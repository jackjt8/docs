# Chunky Plugins

!!! info "Renderer switching in Chunky 2.4.0 or later"
      As of Chunky 2.4.0 renderer switching is supported. ChunkyClPlugin’s `ChunkyCLRenderer` cannot yet be selected to be
      used in conjunction with the Denoising Plugin though they won’t cause an exception anymore.
      
      Plugins which have not yet been updated to support the new `addRenderer` API feature (Ambient Occlusion Plugin 
      and Depth Buffer Plugin) are still supported and are added with the name of _PluginRenderer_.

### Installation
Clicking `Manage Plugins` within the [Chunky Launcher](../getting_started/installing.md) will open the `Plugin Manager`.
Plugins, which are `.jar` files, can be added by clicking the `Add` button.

** Installation **

1. Download the (pre-)release denoiser `.jar` from the Github Repo.

    |    Version     |         Plugin File           |
    |----------------|-------------------------------|
    | Chunky 2.4+    | `chunky-denoiser.jar`         |
    | Chunky 2.0-2.3 | `chunky-denoiser-chunky2.jar` |
    | Chunky 1       | `chunky-denoiser-chunky1.jar` |
    
2. Download the [Precompiled Intel Open Image Denoise Binary Packages](https://www.openimagedenoise.org/downloads.html)
   for your OS. (ie for Windows it would be `oidn-1.4.1.x64.vc14.windows.zip`)
3. Extract the oidn `.zip` file to a chosen location. (ie `C:\Program Files\oidn-1.4.1.x64.vc14.windows\...`)
4. Add and enable the denoising plugin `.jar` in Chunky.
5. After launching Chunky, a new Denoiser tab will be found among the render controls. Expand this tab, next to the 
   Denoiser there will be a button `...` clicking this will open a file selector. Navigate to the install location and
   then into bin and select `oidnDenoise.exe`. The full path to the Denoiser would be displayed in the text field. 
   For this example it would be: `C:\Program Files\oidn-1.4.1.x64.vc14.windows\bin\oidnDenoise.exe`
6. Render normally! Profit! The Denoising Plugin with render the Normal and Albedo Map before the Noisy image.
   Once the Target SPP is reached the image will be denoised and saved into snapshots with the extension `*.denoised.*`.
   You can also find the original .pfm files in the scenes directory should you wish to use these for anything.

### Octree Plugin
[:material-account: aTom3333](https://github.com/aTom3333) &middot; [:material-github: GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aTom3333/chunky-octree-plugin) &middot; [:material-tag: Releases](https://github.com/aTom3333/chunky-octree-plugin/releases)

This is a plugin for Chunky that adds more octree implementations with a range of uses and benefits. See the GitHub
repository for more information and use. Notable implementations:

* Disk Implementation - Caches octree to disk. Extremely slow compared to other octree implementations but bypasses
  memory limits when loading large worlds.
* Garbage-collected Implementation - Generally faster octree creation / loading times. Higher peak memory usages.
* Dictionary Implementation - Lower memory usage than `PACKED`. Slightly slower while rendering and loading.
* Small DAG Implementation - Even lower memory usage than `DICTIONARY`. Slightly slower while rendering and loading.
